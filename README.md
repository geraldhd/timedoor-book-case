# üìö Timedoor Backend Programming Exam ‚Äì Laravel Bookstore Project

## üìñ About This Project

This is a Laravel-based bookstore management system created for the **Timedoor Backend Programming Exam**.
The system allows listing books with filtering options, showing the top 10 authors based on ratings, and submitting ratings for books.

Data is **auto-generated** using Laravel seeders, so once you set up the project, you will immediately have:

* **1,000** fake authors
* **3,000** fake book categories
* **100,000** fake books
* **500,000** fake ratings

## üìù Important Notes for Timedoor Test

* **Preloaded Data:** When the application first opens in the list view, it will already display the data provided via Laravel seeders. No manual data input is required.
* **No Caching:** The project does **not** use any form of caching (Laravel cache, Redis, query caching, etc.) to ensure all queries run directly from the database for evaluation purposes.
* **Database:** This project uses **MySQL** as the only supported database engine.
* **No SQL Dump:** There is **no** `.sql` or MySQL dump file included. All data is generated dynamically using Laravel's seeder system via `php artisan migrate --seed`.
